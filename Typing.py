    "Jamie Jones wrote crime novels. What she hadn't expected was for her partner to go missing, and for all eyes to be trained on her. With her career, she shouldn't have been too surprised. Her search history was concerning, to say the least. The most bizarre part of it all, was her considering the fact that maybe they were right.",
    "It was 1902, the sun was shining. The birds were chirping. I was writing silly little writing prompts for a silly little game. There was a pirate ship. There was a pirate. It was by far, a curious adventure that was being partaken. That''s all for this one. Please defeat the monster."
